config_gen README

INTRO:

config_gen is a standalone utility to simulate the manufacturing flow for
a device running the Ayla Linux client.  It generates a fully populated JSON
configuration file for devd (Ayla device daemon) as well as appending an entry
to the manufacturing log file that must be submitted to Ayla to activate
the device using the generated config file.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

Build config_gen by cd-ing into the config_gen project directory and typing
"make install".  This will compile the config_gen tool, dependent libraries,
and copy the executable to the default build install directory:
<project root>/build/native/util.  Note: the following Linux packages are
required:
* openssl (developer package)
* jansson (version 2.7)


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Run the utility from the Linux command line using the following parameters:
config_gen -d <dsn_path> -i <oem_info_file> [-n]|[-m <MAC_address>] [-o <output_dir>] [-v <verbosity>]

Required:
* dsn_path - 		the path to the DSN XML file output by the Ayla Factory
			Service
* oem_info_file -	the path to the OEM info file containing OEM and
			manufacturing-specific info.  See the sample_input
			directory to see what information should be included
			in the oem_info file.
Optional:
* no_mfg_log -		Omits manufacturing log generation.  Logs are not required
			for development devices.
* MAC_address -		the MAC address of the device this config file will be
			used with.  This is a required parameter unless the mfg
			log is not generated (-n option).  The MAC must be
			input as six bytes in hexidecimal, without delimiters.
* output_dir -		The directory to write config files, used DSN files,
			and the manufacturing log to.  This directory will be
			created if it does not exist.
* verbosity -		Adjusts the verbosity of console output.
			0 - Silent.  No console output will be printed if 
			    correct command line parameters are provided.
			1 - Print errors, warnings, and info (default).
			2 - Print debug messages in addition to default output.

Example usage:
config_gen -d dsns/AC000W000123456.xml -i ./oem_info -m 112233445566 -o ./ayla_config -v 1
